I'm not the best person to explain things but I improve myself every day. So If you are in trouble, I maybe can do something. Just ask.

## A funny story

When I was a scout, we went kayaking. At the end of day, the bus arrived to take us back to the departure (where our parents were waiting for us). But my chiefs forgot me along the river. They finally found me walking the street alone with my diving suit and the kayak paddle...

**TL;DR**

Always get a bi-person kayak.
